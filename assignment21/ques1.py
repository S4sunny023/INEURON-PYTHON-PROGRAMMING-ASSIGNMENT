'''Question1
Write a function that takes a list and a number as arguments. Add the number to the end of the list, then remove the first element of the list. The function should then return the updated list.
Examples
next_in_line([5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 1) ➞ [6, 7, 8, 9, 1]

next_in_line([7, 6, 3, 23, 17], 10) ➞ [6, 3, 23, 17, 10]

next_in_line([1, 10, 20, 42 ], 6) ➞ [10, 20, 42, 6]

next_in_line([], 6) ➞ "No list has been selected"'''


def next_in_line(lst, num):
    if not lst:
        return "No list has been selected"
    lst.append(num)
    lst.pop(0)
    return lst


print(next_in_line([5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 1))
print(next_in_line([1, 10, 20, 42 ], 6))
print(next_in_line([7, 6, 3, 23, 17], 10))
print(next_in_line([], 6) )
